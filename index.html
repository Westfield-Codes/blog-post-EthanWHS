  id="blogtitle">Why do so many people travel to California?</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>October 15th, 2024 by <a href="mailto:ethan202149@student-schoolsofwestfield.org"><em>Ethan Guay</em></a>.</p>
  <p>The roads of Yosemite became more winding and headache-inducing the further we traveled up the mountain. My sister couldn’t handle it and ended up throwing up, and unfortunately, that made for one of the most memorable parts of Yosemite.
  <br>California has something to offer for everyone. It's the most visited state in the US by both <strong>domestic</strong> and <strong>international</strong> travelers, attracting more than 50 million visitors in 2023. <em>But why?</em>

  <h2>So Much to See</h2>
I traveled to California in 2021, and we packed a lot into just two weeks. We saw a wide range of different places, from the tall sequoia trees in Yosemite to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. 
<br>
It seemed like, throughout the trip we would never be able to get everything done–and to some extent that was true. Luckily, we had planned the trip so that we could avoid that, but realistically you can’t see everything California has to offer in just 14 days. 
<h2>Profiting from the Pandemic</h2> 
Half of our time in California was spent in the bigger cities like San Francisco, San Diego, and Los Angeles. When we went to these cities I was surprised that–although there was a worldwide pandemic going on–it was still very busy. 
<br>
Even then, I think we went at the perfect time. The pandemic had calmed down, which allowed us the opportunity to go. You might be asking yourself: “How was it the perfect time to go if it was still very busy?” The answer to that question is very simple: the crowds would have been doubled if it was just a regular summer, free of COVID-19.
<h2>Reasons to travel to California</h2>
California is known for its range of tourist locations, from the natural beauty of Yosemite National Park to the famous Hollywood sign in Los Angeles. California has theme parks that you won’t be able to find anywhere else like the first Disney theme park, Disneyland. It is known for having immerseful roller coasters and a place to make long lasting memories, after all their slogan is “The Happiest Place on Earth.”
